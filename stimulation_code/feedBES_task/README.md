## Additional info
This task aims at exploring the feedback signals to early visual cortex eithe
from episodic and semantic memory traces. In this case, episodic and semantic
are equivalent to semantically congruent and incongruent. Participants
are first expose to a learning phase and then, retrieval is performed
inside the scanner.

## Version info
- Extensive training and the positioning checking task in the training phase.
- Online vividness rating for scanner task.
- Pre-scanner training for Day 1.
