# FeedBES: Feedback from Episodic and Semantic memories in early visual cortex.

**Author:** Javier Ortiz-Tudela (ortiztudela@psych.uni-frankfurt.com)

**Brief description:** This task aims at exploring the feedback signals to early visual cortex either from episodic and semantic memory traces. In this case, episodic and semantic are equivalent to semantically congruent and incongruent. Participants are first expose to a learning phase and then, retrieval is performed inside the scanner.

## Instructions
- genParam needs to be run once for each participant at the beginning. This script will generate a file under `results` with the appendix `param`. **Do not lose this file**
- Then, the `launcher` can be used to trigger the different phases in the experiment.
