The stimulation used in this project is divided here in two groups of scripts. The first one contains the main task under `feedbes_task` and it was used to run the learning session, the scanner training, the retrieval session, the target mapping and the post-scanner task. 

We also used [polar angle and eccentricity stimulation](https://github.com/ortiztud/Retinotopy_mapping_stimuli/blob/master/eccentricity_polar.py) to map the visual field. Credits to @rockNroll87q and @felix_non.
